# About the Site

AppBay connects people who know how to build apps(Developers) with people who have a great idea for an app, but dont have the time/knowledge to make their idea a reality(Ideaists). Eventually their will be a way for developers to buy/license/bid on app ideas they'd like to build. This will allow the people with that one in a million idea to actually see their app in action.
